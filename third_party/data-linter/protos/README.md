This directory contains the following protos:

* `lint_result.proto`. This proto is original to this project.
* `example.proto`, `feature.proto`. These are TensorFlow
  protos. `lint_result.proto` has a dependency on these protos, so we include
  them here to make it easy to generate the necessary Python files for
  `lint_result.proto`. `example.proto` was modified so that it looks for
  `feature.proto` in this directory. Original sources obtained from:
  * https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/example/example.proto
  * https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/example/feature.proto
* `feature_statistics.proto`. This is from the Facets project, and was obtained
  from
  https://github.com/PAIR-code/facets/blob/master/facets_overview/proto/feature_statistics.proto.
  We use this proto to read in summary statistics generated by Facets.
